## Basic AND XOR OR Properties

### Basic AND Properties
1. **Even/Odd Number**
In binary representation, if a number is even, then its least significant bit (LSB) is 0. 
Conversely, if a number is odd, then its LSB is 1. 

    * **A & 1 = 1** (if A is odd)
        ```cpp
        181 = 10110101 //181 is odd, therefore LSB is 1

        10110101 & 1 = 1 // Performing Bitwise AND Operation

        Since, 181 is odd, Bitwise AND with 1 gave 1.
        ```
    * **A & 1 = 0** (if A is even)
        ```cpp
        180 = 10110100 //180 is even, therefore LSB is 0

        10110100 & 1 = 0 // Performing Bitwise AND Operation

        Since, 180 is even, Bitwise AND with 1 gave 0.
        ```
2. **A & 0 = 0** (for all values of A)
3. **A & A = A** (for all values of A)

### Basic OR Properties
1. **A | 0 = A** (for all values of A)
2. **A | A = A** (for all values of A)

### Basic XOR Properties
1. **A ^ 0 = A** (for all values of A)
2. **A ^ A = 0** (for all values of A)

### Commutative Property
The order of the operands does not affect the result of a bitwise operation. 

```cpp
A & B = B & A // Bitwise AND
A | B = B | A // Bitwise OR
A ^ B = B ^ A // Bitwise XOR
```

### Associative Property
* It states that the grouping of operands does not affect the result of the operation. 
* In other words, if we have three or more operands that we want to combine using a bitwise operation, we can group them in any way we want, and the final result will be the same.

```cpp
(A & B) & C = A & (B & C) // Bitwise AND
(A | B) | C = A | (B | C) // Bitwise OR
(A ^ B) ^ C = A ^ (B ^ C) // Bitwise XOR
```

### Question

Evaluate the expression: a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b

### Choices

- [ ] a ^ b ^ a ^ b
- [ ] b
- [ ] b ^ d
- [x] d

### Explanation

We can evaluate the expression as follows:
```cpp
a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b = (a ^ a) ^ (b ^ b) ^ d // grouping the a's and the b's
= 0 ^ 0 ^ d // since a ^ a and b ^ b are both 0
= d // the result is d
```

Therefore, the expression a ^ b ^ a ^ d ^ b simplifies to d

### Question

Evaluate the expression: 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5

### Choices

- [ ] 5
- [ ] 3
- [x] 2
- [ ] 1

### Explanation

We can evaluate the expression as follows:
```cpp
1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5 = ((1 ^ 1) ^ (3 ^ 3) ^ (5 ^ 5)) ^ 2 // grouping the pairs of equal values and XORing them
= (0 ^ 0 ^ 0) ^ 2 // since x ^ x is always 0
= 0 ^ 2 // since 0 ^ y is always y
= 2 // the result is 2
```
Therefore, the expression 1 ^ 3 ^ 5 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 1 ^ 5 simplifies to 2.

## Single Number 1

### Problem Statement
We are given an integer array where every number occurs twice except for one number which occurs just once. Find that number.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [4, 5, 5, 4, 1, 6, 6]
**Output:** 1
`only 1 occurs single time`

**Example 2:**

Input: [7, 5, 5, 1, 7, 6, 1, 6, 4]
Output: 4
`only 4 occurs single time`

### Brute Force
Traverse the array and count frequency of every element one by one.
T.C - O(N^2)
S.C - O(1)

### Idea
What is A^A ? 
ans = A^A is 0

### Approach 1: 
Since ^ helps to cancel out same pairs, we can use it.
Take XOR of all the elements.


### Pseudocode
```cpp=
x = 0;

for (i = 0 to arr.size - 1) {
    x = x ^ arr[i]; // XOR operation
}
    
print(x);
```

### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)


### Approach 2: 
*Interesting Solution!*
Bitwise operators work on bit level, so let's see how XOR was working on bits.
For that, let's write binary representation of every number.

### Observations:
For every bit position, if we count the number of 1s the count should be even because numbers appear in pairs, but it can be odd if the bit in a single number is set for that position.

* We will iterate on all the bits one by one.
* We will count the numbers in the array for which the particular bit is set
* If the count is odd, in the required number that bit is set.

### Pseudocode
```javascript
ans = 0;
    
for(i -> 0 to 31) { // go to every bit one by one  
    cnt = 0;
    
    for(j -> 0 to arr.size - 1) { // iterate on array
   
       // check if ith bit is set
       if((arr[j]& (1<<i))cnt++;
    }
          
    if(cnt & 1) // If the count is odd
        ans = ans | 1 << i; // set ith bit in ans
}
  
print(ans);
```

### Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(N)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Left Shift Operator (<<)
* The left shift operator (<<) shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
* The left shift operator can be used to multiply a number by 2 raised to the power of the specified number of positions.

Example: a = 10 
Let's see a dry run on smaller bit representation(say 8)
Binary Representation of 10 in 8 bits: 00001010
```cpp
(a << 0) = 00001010 = 10
(a << 1) = 00010100 = 20  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 2) = 00101000 = 40  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 3) = 01010000 = 80  (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 4) = 10100000 = 160 (mutiplied by 2)
(a << 5) = 01000000 = 64  (overflow, significant bit is lost)
``` 

In general, it can be formulated as:
```cpp
a << n = a * 2^n
1 << n = 2^n
```
However, it's important to note that left shifting a number beyond the bit capacity of its data type can cause an **overflow** condition. 

In above case, if we shift the number 10 more than 4 positions to the left an overflow will occur.


```cpp
(a << 5) = 01000000 = 64 
//(incorrect ans due to overflow)
// correct was 320 but it is too large to get stored in 8 bits
```

**Note:** We can increase the number of bits, but after a certain point it will reach limit and overflow will occur.

## Right Shift Operator (>>)
* The right shift operator (>>) shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. 
* When we right shift a binary number, the most significant bit (the leftmost bit) is filled with 0.
* Right shift operator can also be used for division by powers of 2.

Letâ€™s take the example of the number 20, which is represented in binary as 00010100. Lets suppose, it can be represented just by 8 bits.
```cpp
(a >> 0) = 00010100 = 20
(a >> 1) = 00001010 = 10 (divided by 2)
(a >> 2) = 00000101 = 5  (divided by 2)
(a >> 3) = 00000010 = 2  (divided by 2)
(a >> 4) = 00000001 = 1  (divided by 2)
(a >> 5) = 00000000 = 0  (divided by 2)
```
In general, it can be formulated as:
```cpp
a >> n = a/2^n
1 >> n = 1/2^n
```
Here, overflow condition doesn't arise.

### Question

What will we get if we do 1 << 3 ?

### Choices

- [ ] 1
- [x] 8
- [ ] 3
- [ ] 4

## Power of Left Shift Operator

Let's see how left shift operator can be used in combination with other operators like (OR, AND, XOR) to set, unset, check or toggle an ith bit.


## SET ith bit

**Left Shift Operator** can be used with the **OR** operator to **SET** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in the number.

```
N = (N | (1<<i))
```
It will SET the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit if it is UNSET else there is no change.

### Example

<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/167/original/or_operator.png?1706037170" width=500 />

---

## TOGGLE ith bit

**Left Shift Operator** can be used with the **XOR** operator to **FLIP(or TOGGLE)** the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit in the number.

```
N = (N ^ (1<<i))
```
After applying the operation, if the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET, then it will be UNSET or vice-versa.

### Example
<img src="https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/063/165/original/xor_operator.png?1706037082" width=500/>

## CHECK ith bit whether it is set or unset

Taking **AND with 1** can help us. 
0 & 1 = 0 
1 & 1 = 1

1. We can shift 1 to the ith bit.
2. If `X = (N & (1<<i))`
    * if X > 0, then **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set.
    * else **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is not set.

### Example
Suppose we have 
```
N = 45
i = 2
```
The binary representation of 45 is:
```
1 0 1 1 0 1
```
The binary representation of (1<<2) is:
```
0 0 0 1 0 0
```

45 & (1<<2) is 
```
0 0 0 1 0 0
```

It is greater than 0. Hence **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
function checkbit(N, i){
    if(N & (1<<i)){
        return true;
    }
    else{
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Complexity 
**Time Complexity** - O(1).
**Space Complexity** - O(1).

## UNSET ith bit

#### Example

Suppose we have a number ```N = 6```
Binary Representation of 6:
```
1 1 0 0
```
We have to unset its 2nd bit

```
1 0 0 0
```

### Approach 

First of all, we can check if the bit is set or not by taking & with 1.

```
X = (N & (1<<i))
```
Then, we have two condition:
* if X > 0, it means the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is SET. To UNSET that bit do:
`N = (N ^ (1<<i))` {XOR with 1 toggles the bit}

* else if it is UNSET, no need to do anything.

### Pseudocode
```cpp
Function unsetbit(N, i){
    X = (N & (1<<i));
    if(checkbit(N,i)){
        N = (N ^ (1<<i));
    }
}
```
### Complexity 
**Time Complexity** - O(1)
**Space Complexity** - O(1)

## Problem 2 Count the total number of SET bits in N

### Problem Statement

Given an integer **N**, count the total number of SET bits in **N**.

### Input
```
N = 12
```
### Output
```
2
```

### Approach 1

Iterate over all the bits of integer(which is maximum 32) and check whether that bit is set or not. If it is set then increment the answer(initially 0).

```cpp
function countbit(N){
    ans = 0;
    for(i -> 0 to 31){
        if(checkbit(N, i)){
            ans = ans + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```

Here, checkbit function is used to check whether the **i<sup>th</sup>** bit is set or not.

### Approach 2
To count the number of SET bits in a number, we can use a Right Shift operator as: 

* Initialize a count variable to zero.
* While the number is not equal to zero, do the following:
    * Increment the count variable if the **0<sup>th</sup>** bit of the number is 1.
    * Shift the number one bit to the right.
    * Repeat steps a and b until the number becomes zero.
* Return the count variable.

```cpp
function countbit(N){
    ans = 0;
    while(N > 0){
        if(N & 1){
            ans = ans + 1;
        }
        N = (N >> 1);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

---
### Question

What is the time complexity to count the set bits ?

### Choices

- [x] O(log N)
- [ ] O(N) 
- [ ] O(N^2)
- [ ] O(1)

### Explanation 

O(log(N)), where 'N' is the value of the given number. 

Since there are log(N) bits in a number and we are going through all the bits one by one, the time complexity of this approach is O(log(N)).

* **Time Complexity** - O(log(N)) 
* **Space Complexity** - O(1)


---
## Single Number 3 

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array, all the elements will occur twice except two. Find those two elements.

**Input:** [4, 5, 4, 1, 6, 6, 5, 2]

**Output:** 1, 2

### Hint:

* Will finding XOR help ? May be!
* What do we get if we XOR all numbers ? XOR of the two unique numbers!
* From that can we identify/separate the two numbers ? Not Really! Why?
    * Example: If XOR is 7, we aren't sure which 2 numbers are they. (2, 5), (1, 6), (3, 4), ... have xor = 7, so we won't be able to identify!


***Is there any way in which we can identify the two numbers from their XOR ?***

Suppose if two unique numbers are **a** and **b**. Their XOR is **c**.
In **c** if say 0th bit is set, what does that tell about a and b ?
In one of the numbers the bit is set and in other the bit is unset! So, can we identify the numbers based on that ?

### Idea:

* We will find the position of any set bit in XOR c, it will denote that this bit is different in a and b.
* Now, we divide the entire array in two groups, based upon whether that particular bit is set or not.
* This way a and b will fall into different groups.
* Now since every number repeats twice, they will cancel out when we take XOR of the two groups individually leaving a and b.


### Pseudocode

```cpp=
    xorAll = 0;

    // XOR of all numbers in the array
    for (i -> 0 to N - 1) {
        xorAll ^= A[i];
    }

    // Find the rightmost set bit position
    // Note: Any other bit can be used as well
    declare pos 
    
    for(pos = 0; pos < 32; pos++)
    {
        if(checkbit(xorAll,pos))
            break;
    }

    num1 = 0;
    num2 = 0;

    // Divide the array into two groups based on the rightmost set bit
    for (i -> 0 to N - 1) {
        if (checkbit(A[i], pos)) {
            num1 ^= A[i];
        } else {
            num2 ^= A[i];
        }
    }

   print(num1);
   print(num2);
```
